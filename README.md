## About the CSV
- Some values are marked as -1 or NULL meaning the information wasn't available
- Some columns are empty for the same reason
- I had to fill in some values with NULL or -1 to make the `json-to-csv.py` script work.

- I have changed the output file name and location for `json-to-csv.py` in case you choose to run it again so it does not overwrite my CSV.
- The CSV was in the `data` folder was hand-audited and added to. Both in column values and for row KV-32.
