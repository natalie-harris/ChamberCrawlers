# ChamberCrawlers
Using Evolution-Inspired Models to Predict the Location of Hidden Tombs in the Eastern Valley of the Kings

## Usage
- Create and open a virtual environment
- You'll need to run `pip install rasterio numpy matplotlib mesa` to install the libraries 
- 

## Why ABM
Unlike a standard statistical model (which predicts "yes/no" directly),
an ABM lets us simulate:

- Builders preferring hillsides or valleys
- Builders preferring certain elevations
- Builders preferring distances from previous tombs
- Builders preferring specific layouts (straight, bent corridors)
- Builders preferring "East Bank" or "West Bank"

This matches how tombs were actually planned historically.

# Lost Pharaoh Tombs
- Thutmese II of the 18th dynasty (found in 2022 in the Valley of the Queens)
- Ramses VIII of the 20th dynasty


## GeoPandas
https://geopandas.org/en/v0.8.2/data_structures.html#geodataframe
### Attributes
area: shape area (units of projection â€“ see projections)
bounds: tuple of max and min coordinates on each axis for each shape
total_bounds: tuple of max and min coordinates on each axis for entire GeoSeries
geom_type: type of geometry.
is_valid: tests if coordinates make a shape that is reasonable geometric shape (according to this).

## About the CSV
- Some values are marked as -1 or NULL meaning the information wasn't available
- Some columns are empty for the same reason
- I had to fill in some values with NULL or -1 to make the `json-to-csv.py` script work.

- I have changed the output file name and location for `json-to-csv.py` in case you choose to run it again so it does not overwrite my CSV.
- The CSV was in the `data` folder was hand-audited and added to. Both in column values and for row KV-32. 

- In regards to the dynasties, if it is a -1, it still occured within the 18-20th dynasties. 

- In regards to **Interior Layout**, I would group `corridors and chambers` with `corridors and chamber` 

## Notes on the ABM itself 4-29-2025
1. Rules
    - Elevation preference: 150 to 200 m (+/- 10-15 meters of our max and min in the dataset)
    - Don't overlap with the existing tombs (~200 m; 25 m less than the median distance between tombs).
    - West Bank only
    - More rules to be added based on cultural burial practices AFTER a basic model is running
        - Model different spacing by tomb type later (royal vs official vs animal)
2. Environment
    - 2D continuous grid
        - X-axis: position (meters across the Valley)
        - Y-axis: position (meters across the Valley)
        - Each point (x, y) can have:
            - Elevation
            - Bank side (East or West)
        - The Valley of the Kings is >1000 feet (300 m) so we'll set the dimensions to **1600 m (X) x 1100 m (Y)** (added 100 m to either side for buffer)
        [Using this map for reference](https://thebanmappingproject.com/sites/default/files/plans/Valley%20of%20the%20Kings.pdf)
    - Elevation Map: a basic elevation field.
        - Higher toward the cliffs, lower toward valley center.
    - West Bank boundary
        - Designate an X or Y line that separates West vs East.
    - Existing tombs
        - Seed the space with real tombs already placed, to check for/avoid overlaps.
3. Stepping
    - One tomb per step. Tombs were commissioned for death. A once in a lifetime event (literally). Unlikely that several tombs were being built at once. I could be wrong about this though, so we might need to change this based on research.
