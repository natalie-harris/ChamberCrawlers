The entire eastern half of this hill/ridge has been quarried away, leaving a large artificial flat plateau as the tomb's courtyard, sloping downward to the northeast. Question: was the tomb built first before the hill was quarried (in which case a substantial section of the corridor was removed), or was the tomb built secondly, after the hill was quarried? The large-scale excavation of this hillside leaves a clear unobstructed line of sight from the entrance of tt072 (located behind) to the mortuary temple of Tuthmosis III on the plain below. The owner of tt072 (Ra) was high priest of that temple, and if he himself did not cut away the obstructing hillside, then he located his tomb to take advantage of this view, as well as to be near the tomb of his own father, tt121 (Ahmose).","Kampp, TN 2, 630, 631;

A ceremonial causeway or dromos leads up to the court from the east along the central axis. The interior hypostyle hall of k028 extends to the west, well under tt366 courtyard above.  In 2006, the court of k028 was nearly completely filled with with radim and spoil from previous excavations; only some mud brick upper walls were exposed. The courtyard also contains the tombs: p155 in northwest corner, p154 east of p155, k086 in the west wall south of k028, and k096 in south wall. Along the south side of causeway near courtyard entrance are: tt244, k268, k272.  GPS location of k028 entry was collected from top of court directly above entrance. Subsequently, from 2009 to 2017, the court and tomb were entirely cleared by a Spanish expedition from Madrid (F. Martin Valentin and T. Bedman), in a stunning and remarkably successful excavation that dramatically reveals the floor and tombs. According to F. Martin Valentin and T. Bedman (2014), k028 dates to the co-regency of Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV, and it apparently proves the coregency lasted at least 8 years; texts of the two kings inscribed on columns in the hypostyle hall appear to date to Amenhotep III's first Sed Festival. Then the hypostyle hall decoration was attacked and names mutilated and destroyed shortly after Year  35, Amenhotep III (similar to tt192). Subsequently, the tomb was usurped for burials under Osorkon I (Dyn. 22), while the hypostyle hall was used in the Third Intermediate Period for embalming priests from Karnak who were buried nearby. Note: the tombs in this section are located here beside the causeway of Thutmose III and the processional route of the Feast of the Valley. For this reason, the dromos of k028 points east toward the causeway and (coincidentally?) the bark station of Thutmose III above tt386.  In this manner, the ceremonial dromos would face the procession of Amun's bark.","Eigner, D. MDAIK 39 (1983): 39-50;

It is built on north-south axis facing south. Date is uncertain, but long axial corridor overlooking Mentuhotep II causeway suggests Middle Kingdom (Dynasty 11). Evidently, it shares a courtyard with mma115 adjacent on the east. Like most tombs in this section, it is built at join of 2 geological strata, softer Esna Shale below and harder Theban Limestone above. Thus, the main body of the tomb is cut into shale, while the ceiling is limestone. The axial corridor is very long; the vaulted limestone ceiling has collapsed in 3 sections and is open to the sky.

The tomb is built on east-west axis facing east.  A rock-cut limestone stairway comes down into the center of the court from the pylon-entrance above. A peristyle of 14 columns surrounds the court on 3 sides: 5 round columns on  each of north and south, and 4 square pillars supporting an entrance portico on the west. The walls of the court are still decorated in parts with painted sculpted texts and scenes, including the lower half of a stela flanking the doorway on the right under the portico. The tomb was repaired and restored by the SCA in the 1980's, including rebuilding the columns in brick and plaster, plastering the stairway, restoring the courtyard walls to their original height and roofing the peristyle and portico with corrugated steel panels. Unfortunately, the restorations have been allowed to deteriorate with larges sectons of the new plaster now falling away. The interior of the tomb is T-shaped with transverse hallways and axial corridor. Situated on the north side of the courtyard of tt023 is is a rough-hewn narrow doorway of the later tomb k325 (owner unknown), which Kampp, TN 2, 588, identifies with tt352 (owner unknown). Since 2006, the tomb has been under study and re-clearance by the Centre for Egyptological Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences (S. Ivanov).

It enjoys commanding view of the plain and temples below. It once was surmounted by a superstructure (pyramid or chapel), now replaced by modern sheikh's shrine (Sheikh Awais el-Qorani). The exterior architecture is unique; with system of rock-cut stairs, terraces, and colonnades, it emulates the style of contemporary Theban royal terrace-temples, althouogh interior is the more usual, simple ""T""-form. It usurps the southern trapezoidal stone buttress-wall of adjoining tt071 (Senenmut) to serve as its northern pylon. On the south, its own southern pylon is a mudbrick hollow-wall structure. The facade and upper court are oriented directly toward the mortuary temple of Thutmose III, while the axial corridor and external main stairway are turned to the temple of Amenhotep II (so Piccione 2018). Ra was the son of Ahmose (tt121) located nearby on north side of tt071. A ""mother,"" also named Ra, is depicted with father Ahmose in transverse hall might actually be grandmother Baket-Ra (Piccione  2018). The tomb apparently dates to the coregency of Thutmose III and Amenhotep II.  In 1914, the MMA discovered an unidentified infant's burial in the floor of the upper court under the south enclosure wall. In Late Antiquity, the tomb became an ancillary of the monastery of Cyriacus or Epiphanius as an atelier or smokehouse.

Also, according to Gnirs et al., the courtyard of the tomb contains the remains of Coptic habitation surmounting 18th Dynasty structures. A brick wall enclosed the courtyard on the east. A vertical shaft in the northwest corner of the court ends in a pair of chambers that breach into a M.K. tomb.

It has an unusually large interior, as well as exterior courtyard. Probably it was completed and enlarged by Ahmose's son, Ra (tt072). It was first usurped late in Dyn. 18 and again in the Late Period. In Late Antiquity, it was apparently prepared as a Coptic monastery, but effort was abandoned before completion. The main burial chamber is accessed by a passage in southwest wall of the transverse hall. The deep vertical shaft on the north side of the outer courtyard (10.8 m.) breaks into the sloping passage of a Middle Kingdom tomb below (mma850). At the intersection, the shaft turns west and winds in a clockwise direction to another burial chamber on the north which also appears original to tt121. Other chambers in the transverse hall and axial corridor were hewn for later burials. The tomb lies directly on a line drawn from the axis of the mortuary temple of Tuthmosis III to the entrance of the tomb of Tuthmosis III in the Valley of the Kings. The owner of tt121 (Ahmose) was First Prophet in the temple of Tuthmosis III. Tomb documented by Charleston expedition (Piccione) along with tt072 and mma850.","Cerny, J. and R. A. Parker.

Also, tt185/206 and k043 must come down a bit on the map below and between tt205 and k042; they are not beside ttT205! Tomb complex excavated more recently by more recent Hungarian expedition to el-Khokha (Z. Fabian), and identification verified. In 2006, tomb was located entirely within a modern house, and only incised decorated doorjambs of entrance were clear in house courtyard. After house was removed, tomb was cleard and restored. Inscriptions on back wall of inner room contain autobiography of owner Seniqer. While PM 1/1, 291, dated tomb to the First Intermediate Period, Saleh (1977), 10, followed by Soliman (2009), 16, dated it to late Old Kingdom based on architecture and decoration, confirmed by Fabian. However, Kampp, TN 1, 475, inexplicably dated it to the Second Intermediate Period.","Fabián, Z. I.

Habachi (1980) argues the tomb owner's name is actually (S)Naa, ""who is called Kheruef,"" according to texts in the tomb. tt192 is located along the south side of the causeway of Thutmose III, facing east, in the central Asasif. It is one of 11 tombs of Dyn. 18 in this area (others also from the reign of Amenhotep III). The tomb appears to be among the largest of private tombs of Dyn. 18, if not the largest (so Habach 1980, 26). The tomb is fronted by a large sunken courtyard accessed by a descending stairway to a decorated doorway that passes into a transverse entrance colonnade. The interior of the tomb is much like contemporary tt055 (Ramose), although of larger scale. Fronting the interior is a decorated portico whose roof and columns have long collapsed. To preserve the relief decoration, this portico has been enclosed in modern times. Beyond is a large hypostyle hall planned for 30 fluted columns (only 1 surviving), leading to a colonnade of 9 pairs of columns, of which only 8 survive. The entrance to the burial chamber is in the floor of the hypo hall against the south wall. The tomb was never completed. The roof of the hypo hall collapsed during its construction, and was abandoned with most of the rubble piled against the south wall. Surviving wall decorations (in various stages of completion), depict the celebration of the Sed Festivals of Amenhotep III. That the decoration also dates to the co-regency with Amenhotep IV is indicated by scenes depicting AIV offering to his father AIII. NB: the nearby contemporary tomb of the vizier Amenhotep Huy also dates to the co-regency. Apparently, very late in reign of Amenhotep III, the figures of Kheruef and others were attacked and mutilated, ironically in an Atenist proscription. tt192 has many intrusions of tombs and burials cut throughout the structure from the Ramesside era through the Third Intermediate Period and later. The rear chamber of tt407 (Bintenduatnetjer), located south of tt192, breaks into Kheruef's collapsed hypostyle hall, southwest corner. Here the rough hole exists in Kheruef's wall (above the burial passage),  about 3 m. above floor (Epigraphic Survey, pl. 6). However when the breakthrough occurred, the hall would have been nearly full of debris at that point.","Dorman, Peter F.

PM 1/1, 421, erroneously identified this Queen Merytamun (actually the daughter of King Ahmose and the sister and wife of Amenhotep I) with the daughter of Thutmose III (who was never a queen). The corridor of the tomb leading to the burial chamber crosses under the Northern Colonnade of the Upper Terrace of Hatshepsut's temple, where foundation blocks of the colonnade above break through the corridor's ceiling. When the tomb was built and sealed is unclear. It is usually said Merytamun died in the reign of Thutmose I (e.g., B. Bryan in Shaw, Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, 219f), so the tomb would predate the temple (so Logan and Williams, Serapis 4 (1977-1978):23-29). However, her eponymous nursery was still functioning in the royal palace in reigns of Thutmose II and Hatshepsut/Thutmose III (Piccione, Fs. J. Johnson (2017),  266). If the tomb predated Hatshepsut's colonnade, why did the builders not shore up the foundation blocks and fill in the corridor below, especially when the foundation blocks and foundation trench broke through? Otherwise, if tt358 is later, it must be assumed the builders were unaware of the foundations so close to where they were cutting, which of course did occur frequently before (e.g., KV 11 and KV 10). If Merytamum lived to be an aged Dowager Queen interred in her own coffin, her tomb could have been built after the colonnade was erected.","Logan, T. J. and Williams, B.

Subsequently it was covered by Tuthmosis  III causeway. Lying on the roof of tt386 (just south of axial corridor below) are the remains of a Tuthmosis III bark shrine (bark resting station), i.e., large limestone foundation block in situ etched/scored with lines marking out the shrine's SE corner, includng the outline of its torus moulding.  Nailed into the center of the torus is a steel nail, representing a survey data point, probably from previous excavations. Two-thirds of roof of entrance colonnade is destroyed and exposed to the sky. The large coutrtyard was later reused as a complex for a number of Late Period (Saite) tombs, including tt389, tt410, tt411, and tombs and chapels built mostly of mudbrick with burial chambers cut into the bedrock. Some of the latter were also located on the roof of tt386. Chapels were excavated by the German and Austrian Institutes.","Arnold, D. Das Grab des Jnj-jt.f. AVDAIK 4.
